## Controls:

Use any of WASD, IJKL, or arrow keys to walk.

Hold down left or right Ctrl to charge up energy. Then hold a direction and let go to pounce, damaging any enemy you land on.

## Debugging

If something goes wrong, back up your key_log.txt file and email it to me. This file records game input. Vegicide never reads nor transmits the file, and it does not contain any identifiable information, only "left arrow up" and "pounce key down"-like events.

Run "DemoReplay" to see a pre-recorded demo. If this demo defeats the pumpking, then your game should work. However, the intricate plot will be spoiled.
